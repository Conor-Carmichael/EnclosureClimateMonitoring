# OctoPrint-Climatemonitor

Climate monitoring plugin for octoprint. Leverages two DHT22 sensors to monitor temperature and humidity both in and outside an enclosure.

## Usage

Default settings expect the data connections for the DHT sensors to be on 4 and 11. Pin 4 would be for the ambient sensor (outside enclosure) and then 11 for the enclosure sensor. There are options for selecting your data pin in the settings menu. 

## Intended Features

* Homescreen temperature/humidity display, and then a tab for a graphed view of each over time. 
* Notification options for various humidity/temp changes
